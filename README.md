# database

In this project, I **successfully implemented** an **online milk tea shop management system** aimed at **enhancing customer experiences** for **small to medium-sized milk tea shops and chains**.

The system **offers** a range of functionalities, starting from **customer registration and login**, **receiving online orders**, and **storing/updating customer information**, to more advanced features like **managing employees** and **generating data reports for profit maximization**.

I used **C# on Windows Form** for the application and **Microsoft SQL Server** for the database. The **database schema** includes tables like:
**Account, Employees, Customers, Points, CustomerTier, Menu, Orders, and OrderDetail**, connected through various types of **relationships**.

I utilized **queries**, such as **SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE**, to handle data operations effectively.
Overall, this project enhanced my understanding of **database setup**, **back-end programming**, and **decision-making skills**.
